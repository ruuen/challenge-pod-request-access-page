## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements
- Receive an error message when the form is submitted if:
  - The `Email address` field is empty should show "Oops! Please add your email"
  - The email is not formatted correctly should show "Oops! Please check your email"

## My process

### Built with

- HTML / CSS / JS
- SASS
- CSS Grid & Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was challenging to complete but extremely rewarding! This was my third challenge which involved form validation, so I attempted to change up my implementation and handle it entirely within JS, including creating of the form's error text element.
